  - [Built with](#built-with)
  - [What I learned](#what-i-learned)

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Given that the challenge was focused just on one page with no complex content I decided to practice building web content with HTML, SASS/CSS and vanilla JavaScript only. I learned more about handling the footer ([this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/) article helped me a lot), and using the `position` CSS property to position the button and error image.
