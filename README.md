# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page solution

This is a solution to the [Base Apparel coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0). Frontend Mentor challenges help improve coding skills by building realistic projects.

## My solution

I hosted my solution on Github Pages [here](https://susi189.github.io/fm-coming-soon-page/).

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

#### SASS

For updating the styles: run the following command in the terminal:

`npm run sass`

This will run the script for compiling the scss file to css, and will listen to any changes made in the `styles.scss` file.

NOTE: Always make the changes in the `styles.scss`.

### What I learned

Given that the challenge was focused just on one page with no complex content I decided to practice building web content with HTML, SASS/CSS and vanilla JavaScript only. I learned more about:

- building a responsive website
- handling the footer and making sure that it always sticks to the bottom of the view point ([this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/) article helped me a lot)
- error handling
- using the `position` CSS property to position the button and error image
